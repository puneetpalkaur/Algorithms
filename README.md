Java code for Algorithms

Algorithms Respository conatains Java Code Implementation for below algorithms:

1. BRUTE FORCE ALGORITHM
This code calculates the maximum sub-array using Brute Force Agorithm

2. BRUTE FORCE IMPROVED ALGORITHM
This code calculates the maximum sub-array using Brute Force Improved Agorithm

3. DIVIDE AND CONQUER
This code calculate the maximum sub array among array of random integers of length n,using Divide and Conquer

4. DIRECTED RANDOM GRAPH
This code generates Directed Random Graph with number of nodes and edges entered by user

5. KADANE'S DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING ALGORITHM
This code calculates the maximum sub-array using Kadane's Dynamic Programming Algorithm

6. LIBRARY SORT
This code sort numbers using Library Sort.Library Sort is an Insertion Sort algorithm that runs in O(n log n)steps with high probability , 
which is optimal for comparison-based sorting.This optimal running time is achieved at the expense of using some extra space epsilon.

7. UNDIRECTED RANDOM GRAPH
This code start with a graph on n vertices with zero edges and then repeatedly add an edge, chosen uniformly at random from all edges not 
currently in the graph, until the graph becomes connected and generates an Undirected Random Graph.
